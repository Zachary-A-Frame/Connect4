### Todo:
    1. Add backend, allowing for more than one player.
    2. Create mobile ready version.
    3. Add dark mode, for night owls.

### Known bugs:
    1. If you click extremely quickly in more than 1 box, it sometimes will skip a turn.

### Fixed bugs:
 ~~Our win checker function doesn't fire off our alert until one move after someone has already gotten 4 in a row.~~
